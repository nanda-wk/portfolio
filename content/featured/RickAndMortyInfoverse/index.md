Rick And Morty Infoverse is an iOS app built using SwiftUI that connects to the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/), allowing users to explore characters, episodes, and locations from the show. The app uses a clean MVVM architecture, includes advanced scroll view behaviors, and features a custom tab bar with animations based on user interaction.
